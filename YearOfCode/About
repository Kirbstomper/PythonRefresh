Hello! If you are reading this I am a little flattered that you would take the time to look at my little ol repository.
The point of this folder is to chronicle my progress of doing Pro/g/ramming Challenges v1.4
I figure that this can be a nice way to keep my skills fresh while also showing off some cool stuff in the list.

I will structure the list like so
Main
    -ProblemFolder
        --Files for the problem



So I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, hope it helps me grow as a programmer, I love solving problems!
